# PETCT-Prediction
Clinical records gathered from hospitalized patients have been in the rise during recent years due to continuous improvements in medical technology and since it has become more accessible to more hospitals around the world. Medical results reported by doctors and from medical instruments are highly important to use for detection, preferably in early stages, for the presence or suspicion of severe disease. Many diseases are still being studied today by doctors to find a proper medical solution to treat patients efficiently and to understand better characteristics. Patients undergo examinations to detect illnesses. These examinations include scans such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Ultrasound. Doctors evaluate the scans, explain the diagnosis results, and suggest types of treatment options to the patients. Recent studies in cancer classification have yet to propose a proper practical solution for helping doctors achieve accurate diagnoses with additional and profound insights from text, especially those written in Hebrew.

We present in this paper a classification system for identifying severity levels of cancer in 10 different sectors of the body. Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) is applied for enlarging essential text information retrieval and robustness to the model while maintaining inference time. This method automatically analyzes PET-CT pathology reports of patients. It indicates the patients current medical state with very high confidence. A large institutional report repository is used from a hospital to extract the semantics of the most contributing factors indicating the patientsâ€™ physical health condition impacted by their disease. The goal of this paper is to significantly increase the improvement of Hebrew PET-CT reports classification accuracy. Augmentation sets are generated and evaluated by the model during test-time to enhance, magnify and deepen the extraction of essential text from each report. This method is the novel of this study and results demonstrate higher performance by AUC evaluation criteria of the TTA model outperforming the Baseline model without TTA integration.
